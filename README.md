# React Navigation & Animation Learning

React Navigation & Animation Learning is my learning journey with React, specifically focused on creating dynamic web pages, mastering navigation, and incorporating animations. This project serves as a living document of my progress and experiments as I dive deeper into React's capabilities. It's structured to highlight key learning areas, showcase mini-projects, and share insights gained along the way.

## Objectives

- **React Basics**: Solidifying understanding of React fundamentals, including components, state management, and lifecycle methods.
- **Navigation in React**: Exploring different methods of implementing navigation within a React application.
- **Animations**: Integrating animations to enhance user experience, using CSS animations.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The core technology behind this project, used for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation in this single-page application setup.
- **CSS**: For styling and animating static elements in the application.
